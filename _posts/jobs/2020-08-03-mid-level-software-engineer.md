Turntabl.io is growing in Ghana! We're a software agency with an international client base and we're looking for mid-level engineers to help manage juniors, projects, and clients.

Experience of building large software projects is critical. If you're ready to move to the next level, help nurture a generation of engineers, and help a Ghana-owned software company grow, please reach out for info <a href="mailto:stoirm@turntabl.io" class="link">stoirm@turntabl.io.</a>.

We can hire in the UK or Ghana; you'd be working in our office in Accra, Ghana. It will be a minimum requirement to spend 2 weeks per quarter in Ghana. To have the desire to go to and experience Ghana is essential, for us it’s a perk of the job not a burden!


### Responsibilities

- You will lead one or more teams of developers as they work on client projects.
- Day-to-day responsibilities include project calls, scrums, pair programming, mentoring, and code reviews.

### Experience
3-5 years of experience with one or more of the following technology areas:
- Python
-C++
- Java
- Angular
- React
- Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Agile software delivery

### Inclusivity
We’re not into the status quo. To us, a successful team is born out of a diverse team. Creating a culture of  equality is not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. Diversity breeds innovation, which is why we encourage all our employees to be their authentic selves - when applying we encourage you to do the same!</br>


Pay is negotiable. In return we can offer rapid personal and professional development through training, mentoring, and taught classes; opportunities with our associated nonprofit <a href="https://globalcode.org.uk/" class="link">Global Code</a>; a young and vibrant office environment in Ghana; and the opportunity to give back in a fundamental practical way.

We're keen to hear from you - please send your CV to <a href="mailto:stoirm@turntabl.io" class="link">stoirm@turntabl.io.</a>
